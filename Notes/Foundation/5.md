-------------- CLOSURES ---------------

function x(){
    var a = 7;
    function y(){
        console.log(a);
    }
    y();
}
x();

Closure means that a function bind together with it's lexical environment.
Function + Lexical Environment is a closure

The function Y is bind to the variables of X, it forms a closure and has access to parent's (x's) lexical scope

function x(){
    var a = 7;
    function y(){
        console.log(a);
    }
    return y;
}
var z = x();
console.log(z);

// logs the funtion y


Since now we have returned the function y into z and the code is executed, x & y will be deleted from the memory, but z has the function y inside it, and y is no more insid of x, as z is in the global scope, how will it behave outside the scope of x?

function x(){
    var a = 7;
    function y(){
        console.log(a);
    }
    return y;
}
var z = x();
console.log(z);

z();

// 7

It still prints 7 which is value of a, here comes closure into picture, functions are so beautiful that when they are returned from another function, they still maintain their lexical scope, they remember where they were actually present. Though x is no longer present in the memory, but y remembers where it came from and it's lexical scope. 

SO WHEN THE FUNCTION WAS RETURNED IN X --> return Y... The whole closure was returned, the function with it's lexical scope. And it was put inside z ---> z = x(); and x() returns the function y() --> which is basically the closure

So, when we execute z in the code, it will still remember the reference to a. (NOT VALUES)

--------- Corner Cases in CLOSURES ---------

function x() {
  var a = 7;
  function y() {
    console.log(a);
  }
  a = 100;
  return y;
}
var z = x();
console.log(z);

z();


When a is changed to 100, the value of a in the emmory is set  to 100.
But when function Y is returned in Z, it is returned with the function Y and the closure which has the refernce to a, but not it's value, here is why we see that 100 is returned but not 7. Only reference to a persists.


function z() {
    var b = 1000;
  function x() {
    var a = 7;
    function y() {
      console.log(a, b);
    }
    y();
  }
  x();
}
z();

Y forms a closure along with lexical scope of x and y
Having refernces to a and b  both.


--------- Corner Cases in CLOSURES ---------

Uses of Closures:
    Module Design Pattern
    Currying in JS
    Function like once (A function that can only run once)
    Memoize
    Maintaining State in Async World
    setTimeouts
    Iterators
    Data Hiding / Encapsulation



-------------------------- INTERVIEWS ------------------------------

function x() {
  var i = 1;
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(i);
  }, 4000);
  console.log("JS POC");
}

x();


// JS POC 
// 1 

// Prints JS POC first and then wait for 4 seconds to print 1

JS Waits for None, the function inside the setTimeout forms a closure and always has refernce to i

What does setTimeout do is ---> It takes the callback function and attaches a timer of 4000 ms to it, stores the callback function somewhere and JS proceeds, JS Engine doesn't wait for anything and executes the next line and print "JS POC"
Once the timer expires then the JS Engine takes the callback function and put it the call stack and then it exectues the callback function

JS doesnt wait for this whole timeout


Print 1 to 5 after every second:
    function x() {
    for(let i = 1; i<=5; i++ ){
    setTimeout(function () {
        console.log(i);
    }, i * 1000);
    }
    console.log("JS POC");
    }

    x();

    This works with let in the for loop because let is block scoped, for every loop iteration there is new copy of i, and each time the callback function is run, it will have the new copy of i. setTimeout callback function forms a closure with the enw variable of i becuase of let. Copy of i in each iteration is new and has a new memory location. It makes 5 copies of i and they form closure with each and every callback function


 With the help of var:
    function x() {
    for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        function close(x){
        setTimeout(function () {
            console.log(x);
        }, x * 1000);
        }
        close(i);
    }
    console.log('JS POC');
    }

    x();

    Everytime we call the closed function with i, it creates a new copy of i for itself
    Everytime a close function is called, it will have a new copy of i


-> Closure is a combnation of a function and it's lexical  scope bundled together. Each and every function in JS has access to it's lexical environment i.e. access to it's parent's environment. 



---> Encapsulation using closures:
    
// Encapsulation using closures

    function counter(){
    var count = 0;
    return function incrementCounter(){
        count++;
        console.log(count);
    }
    
    }

    var counter1 = counter();
    counter1();
    counter1();

    var counter2 = counter();
    counter2();
    counter2();


    // Counter 2 will be a completely different counter function - it will form a new closure with it


    Disadvantages:
        Over Consumption of memory
        Can lead to memory leaks

    Garbage Collector is the concept which frees up the unutilized memory
    JS is a High Level Programming Language - most of the work is done by JS Engine and JS Engine as Garbage collector which frees up all the unused memory


    Relation of Closure and Garbage Collector:
        function a(){
            var x = 0;
            return function b(){
                console.log(x);
            }
        }

        var y = a();


        y();


        The function b forms a closure with the function a, storing the refernce to x, so here the memory of x is not freed. We cannot free this memory until we know that we no longer require the variable y which has the copy of b function

        If we form more closures, we kind of accumulate more memory, and these variables are not garbage collected
