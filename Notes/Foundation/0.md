JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. It was invented by Brendan Eich.

JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:

    - Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
    - Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
    - Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.

Data Types in JS

Variable   | Explanation                                                | Example
-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------
String     | This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify  | let myVariable = 'Bob'; or
           | that the value is a string, enclose it in single or        | let myVariable = "Bob";
           | double quote marks.                                        |
-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------
Number     | This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.  | let myVariable = 10;
-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------
Boolean    | This is a True/False value. The words true and false are   | let myVariable = true;
           | special keywords that don't need quote marks.              |
-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------
Array      | This is a structure that allows you to store multiple      | let myVariable = [1, 'Bob', 'Steve', 10];
           | values in a single reference. Refer to each member of the  | Refer to each member of the array like this:
           | array like this: myVariable[0], myVariable[1], etc.        | myVariable[0], myVariable[1], etc.
-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------
Object     | This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an      | let myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');
           | object and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind  | All of the above examples too.
           | as you learn.                                              |

Some important cases:

typeof 1 ---> to get type of a variable

booleans --> true (1) and false (0)
are also treated as numbers --> true + 10 = 11 
                                false + 10 = 10
                                true * 120 = 120
                                false * 10 = 0
                                true  + '123' = 'true123'
                                true  + 'abc' = 'trueabc'

string '1' + '1' - '11' string
string + number - string  '11' + 1 = '111'
string * num - number '123' * 2 = 246

'a' * 1 = NaN (Not a Number)
'a' + 1 = 'a1'

1.234 + 'abv' = '1.234abv'


Operators in JS

Operator             | Explanation                                                 | Symbol(s) | Example
---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------
Addition             | Add two numbers together or combine two strings.            | +         | 6 + 9;
                     |                                                             |           | 'Hello ' + 'world!';
Subtraction,         | These do what you'd expect them to do in basic math.        | -, *, /   | 9 - 3;
Multiplication,      |                                                             |           | 8 * 2; // multiply in JS is an asterisk
Division             |                                                             |           | 9 / 3;
Assignment           | As you've seen already: this assigns a value to a variable.  | =         | let myVariable = 'Bob';
Strict equality      | This performs a test to see if two values are equal and of  | ===       | let myVariable = 3;
                     | the same data type. It returns a true/false (Boolean) result.|           | myVariable === 4;
Not, Does-not-equal  | This returns the logically opposite value of what it         | !, !==    | 
                     | precedes. It turns a true into a false, etc.. When it is      |           | For "Not", the basic expression is true, but the comparison returns false because we negate it:
                     | used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator  |           | 
                     | tests whether two values are not equal.                     |           | let myVariable = 3;
                     |                                                             |           | !(myVariable === 3);
                     |                                                             |           | 
                     | "Does-not-equal" gives basically the same result with        |           | 
                     | different syntax. Here we are testing "is myVariable NOT    |           | 
                     | equal to 3". This returns false because myVariable IS equal |           | 
                     | to 3:                                                     |           | 
                     |                                                             |           | let myVariable = 3;
                     |                                                             |           | myVariable !== 3;
