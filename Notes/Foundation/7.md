What is a callback function in JS?

Functions are first class citizens in JS, we can take a function and pass into another function. This is what callback functions are.
Because of callback functions we can run JS code asynchronously as it is a single threaded language

JS is a synchronous single threaded language - we can only do one thing at a time and in a synchronous order

function x(){

}

x(function y(){

})

// Here the function y is a callback function
Now it is upto the function x that when y is called back sometime later in the code, that is why they aree called callback functions


JS has just one callstack also called as main thread, all the functions are executed through this call stack only

We should never block our main thread/call stack for heavier tasks and use async operations to avoid this


"In the event listners we pass, call back functions and these call back functions form a closure, because of which these event listners are heavy, that is why we need removeEventListeners."

If we have many event listeners in our code then, it will load slow because of all the extra memory for the closures, and when we removeEventListeners, this extra memory is garbage collected
