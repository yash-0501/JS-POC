-------------- BLOCK SCOPE & SHADOWING -----------------
{}
A block is defined by '{}' (curly braces). It is a perfectly valid JS Code, it does nothing

Block is also known as compund statement

A block is used to combine multiple JS Statements into a group

We group multiple statements in a block when JS Engine expects a single statement

eg: if(true) console.log(true);

Here if we want to run multiple statements, we will have to use a block

if(true){
    let a = true;
    console.log(a);
} 
 These two statements are wrapped together with help of {}
// let a = true;
// console.log(a);
 
 Since if expects a single statement.

 Block Scope - What all vars and functions we declare inside this block

 {
    var a = 10;
    let b = 20;
    const c = 30;
 }

In the above snippet, the variables b and c are hoisted inside the block scope, but a is hoisted inside the global scope/object.

That is why it is said that let and const are block scoped, since we cannot access the let b and const c outside the blocked scope

Whereas we can access the var a, even outside since it is in the global scope.

If we try to access b or c outside the globla scope it will give referenve error b/c is not defined

Once the block is finished executing the block scope, it is gone and the memory is also deleted.


------- SHADOWING IN JS ---------

var a = 100;
{
    var a = 10;
    let b = 20;
    const c = 30;

    console.log(a);
    console.log(b);
    console.log(c);
}
