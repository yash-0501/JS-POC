---------------- Asynchronous nature of JS ----------------

What is meant by Asynchronous?
The term asynchronous refers to two or more objects or events that do not exist or happen at the same time, that is, they are not synchronous . When multiple related things happen without any being dependent on the completion of previous happenings, they are asynchronous.

    In computing, the word "asynchronous" is used in two major contexts:
        1. In networking and communications:
                Asynchronous communication is a method of exchanging messages in which the sending, receiving, and processing of each message is not dependent on the sending, receipt, or processing of other messages. In asynchronous communication, each party receives and processes messages when convenient or possible to do so, rather than doing so immediately upon receipt. Additionally, messages may be sent without waiting for acknowledgement, with the understanding that if a problem occurs, the recipient will request corrections or otherwise handle the situation.

                Email is a type of asynchronous human communication. A sender sends an email. The recipient reads the email and responds to it (or not) at their convenience, not necessarily right away. All parties can continue to send and receive messages at any time. Emails don't have to be scheduled in a particular sequence.
        
        2. In software design:
                Asynchronous software design expands upon the concept by building code that allows a program to ask that a task be performed alongside the original task (or tasks), without stopping to wait for the task to complete. When the secondary task is completed, the original task is notified using an agreed-upon mechanism so that it knows the work is done, and that the result, if any, is available.


Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished. Once that task has finished, your program is presented with the result.

Many functions provided by browsers, especially the most interesting ones, can potentially take a long time, and therefore, are asynchronous. For example:

    Making HTTP requests using fetch()
    Accessing a user's camera or microphone using getUserMedia()
    Asking a user to select files using showOpenFilePicker()

Running long synchronous code can lead to our code becoming unresponsive for a longer time.

The reason for this is that this JavaScript program is single-threaded. A thread is a sequence of instructions that a program follows. Because the program consists of a single thread, it can only do one thing at a time: so if it is waiting for our long-running synchronous call to return, it can't do anything else.

What we need is a way for our program to:

    -Start a long-running operation by calling a function.
    -Have that function start the operation and return immediately, so that our program can still be responsive to other events.
    -Have the function execute the operation in a way that does not block the main thread, for example by starting a new thread.
    -Notify us with the result of the operation when it eventually completes.

That's precisely what asynchronous functions enable us to do. The rest of this module explains how they are implemented in JavaScript.


Event handlers are a form of asynchronous programming: you provide a function (the event handler) that will be called, not right away, but whenever the event happens. If "the event" is "the asynchronous operation has completed", then that event could be used to notify the caller about the result of an asynchronous function call.

Some early asynchronous APIs used events in just this way. The XMLHttpRequest API enables you to make HTTP requests to a remote server using JavaScript. Since this can take a long time, it's an asynchronous API, and you get notified about the progress and eventual completion of a request by attaching event listeners to the XMLHttpRequest object.

----------------- Async Await ---------------- 


The async function declaration creates a binding of a new async function to a given name. The await keyword is permitted within the function body, enabling asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style and avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.

function resolveAfter2Seconds() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('resolved');
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function asyncCall() {
  console.log('calling');
  const result = await resolveAfter2Seconds();
  console.log(result);
  // Expected output: "resolved"
}

asyncCall();

An async function declaration creates an AsyncFunction object. Each time when an async function is called, it returns a new Promise which will be resolved with the value returned by the async function, or rejected with an exception uncaught within the async function.

Async functions can contain zero or more await expressions. Await expressions make promise-returning functions behave as though they're synchronous by suspending execution until the returned promise is fulfilled or rejected. The resolved value of the promise is treated as the return value of the await expression. Use of async and await enables the use of ordinary try / catch blocks around asynchronous code.


Note: The await keyword is only valid inside async functions within regular JavaScript code. If you use it outside of an async function's body, you will get a SyntaxError. await can be used on its own with JavaScript modules.

Note: The purpose of async/await is to simplify the syntax necessary to consume promise-based APIs. The behavior of async/await is similar to combining generators and promises.

Async functions always return a promise. If the return value of an async function is not explicitly a promise, it will be implicitly wrapped in a promise.

---------------- Promises ----------------

Promises are the foundation of asynchronous programming in modern JavaScript. 
A promise is an object returned by an asynchronous function, which represents the current state of the operation. At the time the promise is returned to the caller, the operation often isn't finished, but the promise object provides methods to handle the eventual success or failure of the operation.

Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.

With callbacks to implement asynchronous functions, you call the asynchronous function, passing in your callback function. The function returns immediately and calls your callback when the operation is finished.

With a promise-based API, the asynchronous function starts the operation and returns a Promise object. You can then attach handlers to this promise object, and these handlers will be executed when the operation has succeeded or failed.

promise is first waited until it settles, and the next callback receives the fulfillment value, not the promise itself. It is important to always return promises from then callbacks, even if the promise always resolves to undefined. If the previous handler started a promise but did not return it, there's no way to track its settlement anymore, and the promise is said to be "floating".


Floating promises could be worse if you have race conditions â€” if the promise from the last handler is not returned, the next then handler will be called early, and any value it reads may be incomplete.
