----------- Polyfills ------------


A polyfill is code that implements a feature of the development environment that does not natively support the feature.

What if we require a function xyz and our dev env doesn't support it, and we want to write our own xyz function, we can create our own implementation of it

 - returning a function
 - how the args are being passed
 - how do we handle the args
 - how the refernces are being passed
 - how are we concatenating the args
