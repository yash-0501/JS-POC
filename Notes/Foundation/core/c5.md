--------------- THIS KEYWORD --------------

Behaves very differently in different circumstances.

A function's this keyword behaves a little differently in JavaScript compared to other languages. It also has some differences between strict mode and non-strict mode.

In most cases, the value of this is determined by how a function is called (runtime binding). It can't be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function is called. The Function.prototype.bind() method can set the value of a function's this regardless of how it's called, and arrow functions don't provide their own this binding (it retains the this value of the enclosing lexical context).



this keyword in a global space:
    this keyword in the global space represents the global object

this keyword works differently n strict mode and non strict mode

// Inside a function

function x(){
    // value depends on strict and non strict mode
    console.log(this);
}

strict - undefined
non strict -> globalobject


x();

THIS SUBSTITUTION:
    It is because of this substitution: 
        If the value of this keyword is undefined or null, it's value is replaced with global object only in non strict mode


The value of this keyword also depends on how the function is called (window) in strict mode

x() --> undefined
window.x() --> window object



this inside a object's method

Difference between a function and a method --> When we make a function as a part of an object then it is method


const obj = {
    a:10,
    x:function (){ // method
        console.log(this);
    }
}

obj.x();
// { a: 10, x: [Function: x] }

// call apply and bind are important


How does this keyword work inside arrow functions:

    Arrow functions don't have a this binding associated to it, they take the value of their lexical environment where they are enclosed

   // this object is present in the global scope 
    const obj = {
        a: 10,
        x: () =>{
            console.log(this); // behaves like in the global scope
        }
    }

    obj.x();


    const abc = function(){
    const obj = {
        a: 10,
        x: () =>{
            console.log(this); // have the this keyword of abc lexical scope
        }
    }
        
        obj.x();
    }

    abc();

    tends to inherit this from it's function --> abc



    const obj2 = {
    a: 20,
    x: function (){
        const y = () =>{
            console.log(this);
            // { a: 1, x: [Function: x] }
        }
        y();
    },
};

obj2.x();

// behaves as if this is the part of the obj2

the value of this keyword will be where the arrow function is lexically enclosed



How this keyword behaves inside the DOM:
    <button onClick="console.log(this)"> Click Me </button>
    // [object HTMLButtonElement]

    this refers to the HTML Element in this case HTMLButtonElement

--------- call, apply and bind ----------

used when we want to share methods

// call apply and bind


const student1 = {
    name:"YASH",
    printName:function (){
        console.log(this.name);
    }
}

student1.printName();

// we can share the printName method with Student2 by overriding the value of this keyword

const student2 = {
    name:"Deepika",
}

student1.printName.call(student2);
