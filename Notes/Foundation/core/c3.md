--------------- Promise APIs ----------------

1. Promise.all  --> FAIL FAST

    Promise.all([array]) takes array as input

    It makes n parallel calls and get the result.

    Promise.all([p1,p2,p3]);

    p1 - > 3s success
    p2 - > 1s success
    p3 - > 2s success

    returns an array with result of all these calls [val1,val2,val3]

    How much time will this take ---> 3s

    It waits for all the api calls to be finished.


    Faliure Case:

    Promise.all([p1,p2,p3])

    p1 - > 3s success
    p2 - > 1s rejected
    p3 - > 2s success

    As soon as any of these promises get rejected, promise.all will through an error

    Output will be error thrown by p2, as soon as reject happened in p2, it will through an error

    p1 and p3 promises are not cancelled, thse promises will be eventually accepted or rejected.

    ALL or NONE!!

    It doesn't wait for other promises

2. Promise.allSettled

    Promise.allSettled([p1,p2,p3]);

    p1 - > 3s success
    p2 - > 1s success
    p3 - > 2s success

    returns an array with result of all these calls [val1,val2,val3] after 3 seconds

    Faliure Case:

    Promise.all([p1,p2,p3])

    p1 - > 3s success
    p2 - > 1s rejected
    p3 - > 2s success

    It will wait for all the promises to settle (whether success or failure)

    In this case it will wait for 3 seconds, for all the promises to get settled

    returns [val1, err2, val3] after 3 seconds.



3. Promise.race

    Promise.race([p1,p2,p3])

    p1 - > 3s success
    p2 - > 1s success
    p3 - > 2s success

    As soon as the first promise of settled it will return the value/error

    returns val2 after 1 s 

    Gives the value of the first settled promise

    Promise.race([p1,p2,p3])

    p1 - > 3s success
    p2 - > 1s reject
    p3 - > 2s success

    return err2 

    It returns the result (val/err) of the first settled promise


4. Promise.any  --> waits for first success / resolve
 
    Promise.any([p1,p2,p3])

    p1 - > 3s success
    p2 - > 1s success
    p3 - > 2s success

    As soon as the first promise of resolved it will return the value/error

    returns val2 after 1 s 

    Gives the value of the first resolved promise


    p1 - > 3s success
    p2 - > 1s reject
    p3 - > 2s success


    returns val3 after 2 s 


    
    p1 - > 3s reject
    p2 - > 1s reject
    p3 - > 2s reject

    if all the promises are failed it returns an aggregated error
    [err1,err2,err3]


    ONCE A PROMISE IS SETTLED --> MEANS WE HAVE GOT THE RESULT
        --> RESOLVED / success / fulfilled
        --> REJECTED / failure / rejected
