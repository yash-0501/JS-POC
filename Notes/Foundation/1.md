Javascript - programming language for web applications

Internal Linking - Write JS Code in HTML File
External Linking - Write JS COde in seperate .js file.

JS Executes on top of HTML - When a web browser loads a web page, it first parses the HTML and CSS files. The HTML file defines the structure of the page, and the CSS file defines the style of the page. Once the HTML and CSS files have been parsed, the browser then executes the JavaScript code.

console.log("Hello World") -- for printing -->> logs everything on the console

Semicolons are not required (mandatorily) in JS

Whichever script comes first will be processed first in case of multiple files.

Everything in JS happens inside an Execution Context

 -------------------------------- Execution Context -------------------------------------

 Memory Component (Variable Environment)    ---> variables in key : value pairs
 Code Component (Thread of Execution)  ---> Code is executed one line at a time

 -------------------- *JS is "Synchronous Single Threaded Language"* ------------------------



 
 ------------------------------- Execution of JS Code -----------------------------------------
 What happens when JS Code runs? How the JS Code is Executed

 A Global execution context is created first with Memory Component & Code Component in 2 Phases
        1 - > Memory Creation Phase
        2 - > Code Execution Phase

    
    1- Memory Creation Phase - Skims through the whole code and allocate memory to all the variables and functions
        For Variables ---- It stores the value "undefined"
        For Funcitons ---- It stores the "whole code" of the function

    2- Code Execution Phase - Runs through whole code line by line
        For variables ---- replaces undefined with the value of the variable

        Functions ---- There is nothing to execute in the function

        ***When any function is invoked ----> all together a new execution context is created inside the code component 
        and same process as above is repeated.***

        Then when the return is executed the control returns back and the new execution context created is deleted, the 
        variable which invoked the funtion gets assigned with the value returned.

        When the whole code has run, the whole global execution context is deleted

--------- How JS Engine Manages the Execution of JS Code -----------

There could be cases where there is a function invokation inside a function, maybe then again --- so many invokation inside a function


All this is managed with a call stack

The bottom of the call stack always has the global execution context - (say, GEC)
Whenever a new function is invoked a new execution context is pushed into the stack (say, EC1)
Once the execution of this function is done, the EC1 is popped out from the stack and control goes back to GEC

After the whole code is executed - the call stack is emptied.

"Call stack maintains the order of execution of execution contexts"
