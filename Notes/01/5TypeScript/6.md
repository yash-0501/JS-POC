------------------------------------ ABSTRACT CLASSES ---------------------------------------

We have a normal class and we can create an object from this class.

class TakePhoto{
    constructor(
        public cameraMode: string,
        public filter: string,
    ){}
}

const ya = new TakePhoto("ya", "ya")


as soon as we declare it as abstract, we cannot create an object from it

abstract class TakePhoto{
    constructor(
        public cameraMode: string,
        public filter: string,
    ){}
}

Abstract classes are a blueprint, we cannot create a object from these,
We can create an object from the class which inherits it


An abstract method or abstract field is one that hasn’t had an implementation provided. These members must exist inside an abstract class, which cannot be directly instantiated.

The role of abstract classes is to serve as a base class for subclasses which do implement all the abstract members. When a class doesn’t have any abstract members, it is said to be concrete.


abstract class TakePhoto{
    constructor(
        public cameraMode: string,
        public filter: string,
    ){}

    abstract getPhoto(): void
    getCount(): number{
        return 1;
    }
}

// const ya = new TakePhoto("ya", "ya")

class Insta extends TakePhoto{
    getPhoto(): void{
        console.log("Photo!")
    }
}

const i = new Insta("Panaroma", "False");
i.getCount() // can directly access this, without implementing it in derived class
i.getPhoto()

console.log(i)


The main difference is we can define the strcuture of the derived class and also provide additional featuers to the derived class

--------------------------------- GENERICS ------------------------------------


A major part of software engineering is building components that not only have well-defined and consistent APIs, but are also reusable. Components that are capable of working on the data of today as well as the data of tomorrow will give you the most flexible capabilities for building up large software systems.

In languages like C# and Java, one of the main tools in the toolbox for creating reusable components is generics, that is, being able to create a component that can work over a variety of types rather than a single one. This allows users to consume these components and use their own types.

Hello World of Generics
To start off, let’s do the “hello world” of generics: the identity function. The identity function is a function that will return back whatever is passed in. You can think of this in a similar way to the echo command.

Without generics, we would either have to give the identity function a specific type:

function identityOne(val: boolean | number): boolean | number{
    return val;
}

This way we can only handle either number or boolean, also this may take input as Number and return bool and vice versa

function identityTwo(val: any): any{
    return val;
}

This we can handle all the types but the issue with this is again that if we enter a string, I can return a boolean or anything

Correct way:
function identityThree<Type>(val: Type): Type{
    return val;
}


// Correct Way
// Once we pass anything the value type is locked, then return type automatically becomes that type
// Input Number -> Output: Number
function identityThree<Type>(val: Type): Type{
    return val;
}

// identityThree(false)

function identityFour<T>(val: T): T{
    return val
}

// This way we can define our own types and it passes on




// --------------------- Generics in Array ---------------------------


// here  the return Type is one of the value from that array docs
function searchDocs<T>(docs: T[]): T {
    const index = 3
    console.log(docs.length)
    return docs[index];
}

const getMoreDocs = <T>(docs: T[]): T =>{
    const index = 4;
    return docs[index];
}

// return a array
function loggingIdentity<T>(arg: T[]): T[] {
    console.log(arg.length);
    return arg;
  }
// --------------------- Generics in Array ---------------------------


Using Type Parameters in Generic Constraints:

I want to get an object but not something which looks like an object

function anotherFunc<T, U extends number>(val1: T,val2: U): object{
    return {
            val1,
            val2
        }

}

anotherFunc(3,4);



interface DB{
    connection: string,
    username: string,
    password: string
}

function connectDB<T,U extends DB>(val1:T, val2:U):object{
    return {
        val1,
        val2,
    }
} 

// connectDB(3,{})



// Class Types in Generics

interface Quiz{
    name: string,
    type: string
}

interface Course{
    name: string,
    price: number
}

class Sellable<T>{
    public cart: T[] = []

    addToCart(prod: T){
        this.cart.push(prod)
    }

    printCart(){
        console.log(this.cart);
    }
}

const q: Quiz = {
    name:"Quiz1", 
    type:"Type1"
};
const q2: Quiz = {
    name:"Quiz2", 
    type:"Type2"
};
const c1: Course = {
    name:"Course1", 
    price:200
};


const sell = new Sellable();
sell.addToCart(c1);
sell.addToCart(q);
sell.printCart()
sell.addToCart(q2);
sell.printCart()

Same class can be used to see different types of products, be it Quiz or Courses
