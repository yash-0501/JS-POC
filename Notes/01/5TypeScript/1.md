------------------------- Typescript --------------------------


TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types.
TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

type Script is a super set of JS, but it doesn't add more features to JS.

Allows us to write JS in a much more precise manner, for less errors.

Nothing much new, all code written in TS is compiled in JS.

TypeScript is all about Type Safety -- TypeScript's type safety empowers developers to write more reliable, maintainable, and robust code. 


TypeScript stands in an unusual relationship to JavaScript. TypeScript offers all of JavaScript’s features, and an additional layer on top of these: TypeScript’s type system.

For example, JavaScript provides language primitives like string and number, but it doesn’t check that you’ve consistently assigned these. TypeScript does.

This means that your existing working JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. The main benefit of TypeScript is that it can highlight unexpected behavior in your code, lowering the chance of bugs.


Types by Inference
TypeScript knows the JavaScript language and will generate types for you in many cases. For example in creating a variable and assigning it to a particular value, TypeScript will use the value as its type.

By understanding how JavaScript works, TypeScript can build a type-system that accepts JavaScript code but has types. This offers a type-system without needing to add extra characters to make types explicit in your code. That’s how TypeScript knows that helloWorld is a string in the above example.

You may have written JavaScript in Visual Studio Code, and had editor auto-completion. Visual Studio Code uses TypeScript under the hood to make it easier to work with JavaScript.


The simple idea behind typescript is static checking - analyze the code --> checks and gives us hint that we might be doing something wrong

In TS we write more lines of code as compared to JS

The TS code is transpiled into JS

TS is a dev tool, the project still runs in JS

let user = {name:"yash", age:10};

console.log("hello World");
console.log(user.name);


tsc intro.ts ---> convert ts code into JS

There could be errors but this doessn't prevent in creating JS code

We tend to write more code in TS but this code is always safer code


At what situations typescript helps ---> we dont have to explictly check if a variable is num, array, or string

Suppose a function returns only a string--> while working in a team in TS, we have the sureity that from this function only a  string will be returned


Syntax:

    let variableName: type = value

    let greeting: string = "Hello World!";


    All the datatypes in TS are lowercase


To convert TS into JS, we do "tsc <filename>.ts" --> tranpiles to JS (In this by deafult it is always var, we need to setup config to change that)

-------------------- Types in TS --------------------

Numbers String Boolean
Null undefined Void
Object array tuples
Any never unknown

The primitives: string, number, and boolean

JavaScript has three very commonly used primitives: string, number, and boolean. Each has a corresponding type in TypeScript. As you might expect, these are the same names you’d see if you used the JavaScript typeof operator on a value of those types:

string represents string values like "Hello, world"
number is for numbers like 42. JavaScript does not have a special runtime value for integers, so there’s no equivalent to int or float - everything is simply number
boolean is for the two values true and false


// string
let greeting: string = "Hello World!";

// number
let userid: number = 1;

// boolean
let isPresent: boolean = true;

// Type inference ---> 
let num = 31;

// now if I try to use nums = "string"
//  it will give error

console.log(greeting);

TS automatically identifies the type of the variable


Arrays
To specify the type of an array like [1, 2, 3], you can use the syntax number[]; this syntax works for any type (e.g. string[] is an array of strings, and so on). You may also see this written as Array<number>, which means the same thing. We’ll learn more about the syntax T<U> when we cover generics.


-------------------- Types in TS --------------------


------------------------ ANY keyword -----------------------------

any
TypeScript also has a special type, any, that you can use whenever you don’t want a particular value to cause typechecking errors.

When a value is of type any, you can access any properties of it (which will in turn be of type any), call it like a function, assign it to (or from) a value of any type, or pretty much anything else that’s syntactically legal:

let obj: any = { x: 0 };
// None of the following lines of code will throw compiler errors.
// Using `any` disables all further type checking, and it is assumed
// you know the environment better than TypeScript.
obj.foo();
obj();
obj.bar = 100;
obj = "hello";
const n: number = obj;


let hero;

function getHero(){
    return "Thor";
}

hero = getHero();

// here hero is being infered as ANY


noImplicitAny
When you don’t specify a type, and TypeScript can’t infer it from context, the compiler will typically default to any.

You usually want to avoid this, though, because any isn’t type-checked. Use the compiler flag noImplicitAny to flag any implicit any as an error.
