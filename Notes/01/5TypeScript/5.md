------------------------------ CLASSES in TS --------------------------------



TypeScript offers full support for the class keyword introduced in ES2015.

As with other JavaScript language features, TypeScript adds type annotations and other syntax to allow you to express relationships between classes and other types.

Class Members
Here’s the most basic class - an empty one:

class Point {}
Try
This class isn’t very useful yet, so let’s start adding some members.

Fields
A field declaration creates a public writeable property on a class:

class Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}
 
const pt = new Point();
pt.x = 0;
pt.y = 0;
Try
As with other locations, the type annotation is optional, but will be an implicit any if not specified.


Fields can also have initializers; these will run automatically when the class is instantiated:

class Point {
  x = 0;
  y = 0;
}
 
const pt = new Point();
// Prints 0, 0
console.log(`${pt.x}, ${pt.y}`);


class GoodGreeter {
  name: string;
 
  constructor() {
    this.name = "hello";
  }
}

Note that the field needs to be initialized in the constructor itself. TypeScript does not analyze methods you invoke from the constructor to detect initializations, because a derived class might override those methods and fail to initialize the members.

If you intend to definitely initialize a field through means other than the constructor (for example, maybe an external library is filling in part of your class for you), you can use the definite assignment assertion operator, !:

class OKGreeter {
  // Not initialized, but no error
  name!: string;
}


Class constructors are very similar to functions. You can add parameters with type annotations, default values, and overloads:

class Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
 
  // Normal signature with defaults
  constructor(x = 0, y = 0) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }
}
Try
class Point {
  // Overloads
  constructor(x: number, y: string);
  constructor(s: string);
  constructor(xs: any, y?: any) {
    // TBD
  }
}


There are just a few differences between class constructor signatures and function signatures:

Constructors can’t have type parameters - these belong on the outer class declaration, which we’ll learn about later
Constructors can’t have return type annotations - the class instance type is always what’s returned



A function property on a class is called a method. Methods can use all the same type annotations as functions and constructors:

class Point {
  x = 10;
  y = 10;
 
  scale(n: number): void {
    this.x *= n;
    this.y *= n;
  }
}


Getters / Setters
Classes can also have accessors:

class C {
  _length = 0;
  get length() {
    return this._length;
  }
  set length(value) {
    this._length = value;
  }
}


TypeScript has some special inference rules for accessors:

If get exists but no set, the property is automatically readonly
If the type of the setter parameter is not specified, it is inferred from the return type of the getter
Getters and setters must have the same Member Visibility
Since TypeScript 4.3, it is possible to have accessors with different types for getting and setting.

class Thing {
  _size = 0;
 
  get size(): number {
    return this._size;
  }
 
  set size(value: string | number | boolean) {
    let num = Number(value);
 
    // Don't allow NaN, Infinity, etc
 
    if (!Number.isFinite(num)) {
      this._size = 0;
      return;
    }
 
    this._size = num;
  }
}

some access modifiers: readonly, private, public (by default), protected


 --------------------- Getters and Setters -----------------------

class C {
  _length = 0;
  get length() {
    return this._length;
  }
  set length(value) {
    this._length = value;
  }
}

  set size(value: string | number | boolean) {
    let num = Number(value);
 
    // Don't allow NaN, Infinity, etc
 
    if (!Number.isFinite(num)) {
      this._size = 0;
      return;
    }
 
    this._size = num;
  }
}

A setter cannot have a return type

 --------------------- Getters and Setters -----------------------


 
class User1 {
    protected _courseCount = 1
    readonly city: string = "Jaipur"
    constructor(public email: string, public name: string){
    }

    get getEmail(): string{
        return `myemail${this.email}`;
    }

    get courseCount(): number{
        return this._courseCount;
    }

    set courseCount(courseNum){
        this._courseCount = courseNum;
    }


}

class SubUser extends User1{
    isFam: boolean = true
    changeCourseCount(){
        this._courseCount = 2;
    }
}


const u1 = new User1("y@y.com","yash");
