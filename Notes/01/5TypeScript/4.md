---------------------- Enums in TS ---------------------

Enums are compatible with numbers, and numbers are compatible with enums. Enum values from different enum types are considered incompatible.

Why enums exists?
Enums exists because there are certain times when we want to restrict the user, from entering a certain value

In ecomm. application we restrict the order status --> In wishlist, in cart, shipped, out for delivery ... etc

Whenever we are dealing with choice, we use enums!


enum SeatChoice {
    AISLE,
    MIDDLE = 10,
    WINDOW,
    BUSINESS
}

const seat = SeatChoice.BUSINESS
// we get only four choices AISLE MIDDLE WINDOW BUSINESS

// default value is 0
// if we assign any value to a choice then the choices after that increases from that value
// AISLE - 0
// MIDDLE - 10
// WINDOW - 11
// BUSINESS - 12

// We can also put in strings in the enums


// Enum values from different enum types are considered incompatible. For example,

const enum Status {
    Ready,
    Waiting,
  }
  const enum Color {
    Red,
    Blue = "Blue",
    Green = 0,
}

let colors: Color = Color.Red;

console.log(colors);


Without const enum generates an IIFE else just generate a variable (seat = 0)
