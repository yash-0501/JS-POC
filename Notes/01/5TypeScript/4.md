---------------------- Enums in TS ---------------------

Enums are compatible with numbers, and numbers are compatible with enums. Enum values from different enum types are considered incompatible.

Why enums exists?
Enums exists because there are certain times when we want to restrict the user, from entering a certain value

In ecomm. application we restrict the order status --> In wishlist, in cart, shipped, out for delivery ... etc

Whenever we are dealing with choice, we use enums!


enum SeatChoice {
    AISLE,
    MIDDLE = 10,
    WINDOW,
    BUSINESS
}

const seat = SeatChoice.BUSINESS
// we get only four choices AISLE MIDDLE WINDOW BUSINESS

// default value is 0
// if we assign any value to a choice then the choices after that increases from that value
// AISLE - 0
// MIDDLE - 10
// WINDOW - 11
// BUSINESS - 12

// We can also put in strings in the enums


// Enum values from different enum types are considered incompatible. For example,

const enum Status {
    Ready,
    Waiting,
  }
  const enum Color {
    Red,
    Blue = "Blue",
    Green = 0,
}

let colors: Color = Color.Red;

console.log(colors);


Without const enum generates an IIFE else just generate a variable (seat = 0)

---------------------- Interface in TS -----------------------

Interfaces
An interface declaration is another way to name an object type:

interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}
 
function printCoord(pt: Point) {
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
  console.log("The coordinate's y value is " + pt.y);
}
 
printCoord({ x: 100, y: 100 });
Try
Just like when we used a type alias above, the example works just as if we had used an anonymous object type. TypeScript is only concerned with the structure of the value we passed to printCoord - it only cares that it has the expected properties. Being concerned only with the structure and capabilities of types is why we call TypeScript a structurally typed type system.

Differences Between Type Aliases and Interfaces
Type aliases and interfaces are very similar, and in many cases you can choose between them freely. Almost all features of an interface are available in type, the key distinction is that a type cannot be re-opened to add new properties vs an interface which is always extendable.


interface User {
    email: string,
    userId: number,
    // startTrial: () => string
    startTrial(): string
}

const yash: User = {
    email: "yash@gmail.com",
    userId: 121,
    startTrial: () =>{
        return "trialStarted";
    }
}

// Type vs Interface

// Inheritance

interface Admin extends User{
    role: "admin" | "ta" | "learner"
}


const admin1: Admin = {
    email: "admin@gmail.com",
    userId: 121,
    startTrial: () =>{
        return "trialStarted";
    },
    role: "admin"
}


// Adding new fields to an existing interface

interface Window {
  title: string;
}

interface Window {
  ts: number;
}
