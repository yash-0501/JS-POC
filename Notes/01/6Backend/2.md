----------------------------- Middlewares -------------------------------



In general:
                    
    CLIENT ---------(sends req)-------------> REST API
    REST API --------(return res)-------------> CLIENT

Using middlewares:

    CLIENT --------(sends req)--------> MIDDLEWARE

            Middleware validate this req:
                IF VALID:
                    CLIENT --------(sends req)--------> MIDDLEWARE---------(sends req)-------------> REST API
                    REST API --------(return res)-------------> CLIENT
                ELSE:
                    CLIENT --------(sends req)--------> MIDDLEWARE
                    MIDDLEWARE --------(return err)-------------> CLIENT

Middlewares run on all the requests and responses

Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and the response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware function in the stack.
If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

An Express application can use the following types of middleware:

Application-level middleware
Router-level middleware
Error-handling middleware
Built-in middleware
Third-party middleware

----------------------------- HTTP Headers -----------------------------


An HTTP header is a field of an HTTP request or response that passes additional context and metadata about the request or response. 

HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response. An HTTP header consists of its case-insensitive name followed by a colon (:), then by its value. Whitespace before the value is ignored.

Headers can be grouped according to their contexts:

Request headers
Contain more information about the resource to be fetched, or about the client requesting the resource.

Response headers
Hold additional information about the response, like its location or about the server providing it.

Representation headers
Contain information about the body of the resource, like its MIME type, or encoding/compression applied.

Payload headers
Contain representation-independent information about payload data, including content length and the encoding used for transport.
