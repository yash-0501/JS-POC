-------------- Function Invocation and Variable Environment in JS --------------

var x = 1;
a();
b();

console.log(x);


function a(){
    var x = 10;
    console.log(x);
}

function b(){
    var x = 100;
    console.log(x);
}

// 10
// 100
// 1

In the above code segement when the code is run, first the execution context is created, and memory will be allocated to
variable x->undefined and, functions a->function code of a, and b-> function code of b.

Now when code is executed, in the code component.... 
var x = 1; in the memory of GEC x -> 1

then a(); is called -> now execution context say (EC A) is created with a memory and code components
    Inside EC A -> now the variable x = 10 is now stored in the memory component of (EC A), as a seperate memory all together.
                -> now when the code if executed for this EC A => x -> will now point to 10 in the memory component
                -> then the value of x in EC A will be printed in the console  *10 is printed in the console*
                -> Since now the code is completely executed the whole execution context EC A is deleted and popped from call stack 

Control gets back to GEC

then b(); similarly a  new EC B is created 
    Inside EC B -> x = 100
                -> console.log(x) *100 is printed in the console*
                -> after completion, EC B is deleted and popped of the stack

Control gets back to GEC

then console.log(x) -> now JS will fetch the value of x from the local EC i.e. the GEC, where the value of x is 1
so  then x is printed in the console (1)

final output -> 10
                100
                1

We will have two types of memory local memory and the global memory.
Local memory will be the one of which the code is currently executed.
Say for EC A ---> local memory will have x = 10, while the global  memory (GEC) will still have x as undefined, since the code for the GEC is still not into Code Execution phase

Once whole code is executed, the GEC is also deleted and popped off from the stack.

----------- Shortest JS Program GLOBAL OBJECT --------------

When an empty file is executed/run --> JS Engine still behind the scenes create a GEC (Global Execution Context), and also sets up the memory space.

Window ---> Big Object with lot's of functions and methods, created by JS Engine in the Global Space. These can be accessed anywhere in the JS Code

This ----> At the Global level this points to the window object

What is Window?
A global object which is created along with GEC. Along with these a this variable is also created.

Global object in case of browsers is called as window.

A global object is always created. Even if the file is empty, JS Engine always create the global object

At the global level, this === window ---> this points to global object at the global level

var a = 10;
function b(){
    var x = 10;
}

console.log(window.a) ----> 10
console.log(a) // same as window.a ----> 10

console.log(x)  // tries to find the value of x in the global window which is basically not defined in the global space

Global Space
    In the above code segment, the var a and function b are part of the global space, but the var x, is the part of the local space
    Anything which is not inside a funtion is in global space

    Any variables or functions created in the global space, gets attached to the global object (Window in case of browsers)
    When we try to access any var or function in our code, it assumes that it is in the global space.

---------- Undefined vs not defined in JS ------------

console.log(a) ---> undefined
var a = 7

console.log(x) ----> reference error:   not defined


Undefined is a special keyword is JS and it is not there in other languages. Plays a signifcant role in how the JS code is executed.

When the memory is allocated to all the variables and functions, to the variables JS tries to put a placeholder to the variable, which is placed in the memory, this placeholder is undefined.

So memory is allocated to the variable but the value is undefined. Value is put in the memory component during the code execution phase, then this value undefined changes to whatever values is initialized.

Not defined is the scenario when the variable is not initialized but called., this is the case when during the memory context phase, when the control goes through the whole code assigning different memory locations to the variables and functions which are initilized, it won't find the variable being initialized, so in this case it will give reference eerror, not defined


var a;
console.log(a);

In the above snippet, throughout the whole code execution the value of a will remain undefined, until it is changed.


--- JS and it's variables ---
    JS is a loosely typed language - doesn't atach it's variables to any data type
        If var a = "Hello World";
            later on I want a to be 1001, I can simply do it
            a = 1001 
            There is no data type associated with the variables in JS


    var x;
    console.log(x);

    x = "Hello World"
    console.log(x);

    x = 1001
    console.log(x);

    x = false
    console.log(x);

    Output 
    // undefined  -> until and unless any value is specified the value will be undefined
    // Hello World
    // 1001
    // false

    JS is a loosely typed or Weakly Typed langauge

    "never use something like *a=undefined*" ---> never put value of any variable as undefined
