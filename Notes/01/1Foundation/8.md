------------------- EVENT LOOP ------------------


JS is a synchronous single threaded language it has one call stack and can only one thing at a time.
The callstack is inside the JS engine and all the code is executed inside the call stack.


JS waits for none.

Browser -> JS Engine -> Call Stack

Browser has localStorage, timer, bluetooth, geolocation etc.

"To access all the above things in JS from browsers we need WEB APIs"

Some popular web apis which are part of browsers: 

    1. setTimeout() is a webAPI
    2. DOM APIs - document
    3. fetch() 
    4. localStorage()
    5. console
    6. location

    With the help of these web apis we can access all these functionalities inside the JS engine / call stack

    Global object in case of browsers is window
    and through this window browser gives access to all the above WEB APIs to JS

    window.localStorage() --> gives access to localStorage of the browser

    Browser wraps up all these apis into the global object (window)


Event Loop:     

    console.log("Start");

    setTimeout(function cb(){
        console.log("5 Seconds Completed");
    }, 5000);

    console.log("End");

    // Start
    // End
    // 5 Seconds Completed


    So when the setTimeout is called, the callback function cb, inside it, it gets registered in the window, and since we also passed the delay, the timer is started in the window.

    JS will keep on executing all the code, as soon as it gets to the call stack. Once whole code is executed the GEC also pops off the stack.

    Meanwwhile all this is happening the timer is still running as soon as the timer expires, this callback functions needs to be executed and somehow it needs to get into the callstack.

    Here event loop and call back queue comes into picture.

    CB function -> CB Queue and the event loop will check the CB Queue and if it has something it will put that method into the call stack, and the call stack will quickly execute the call back function.



WHY DO WE NEED THE CALL BACK QUEUE, WHEN WE CAN JUST DIRECTLY USE EVENT LOOP?
When the user clicks on a button 5-6 times continously, so all the call back functions are queued and all are pushed to stack one by one.

    Fetch -------> Goes and requests a api call, returns a promise, and call back function is passed which is executed when the promise is resolved, i.e. when we get this data from the api call.

    So there are two queues
        --> Micro Task Queue
        --> Callback Queue
    
    Priority to go to callback sstack is given to micro task queue

    What can come inside the microtask queue --> 
        1. All the call back functions which comes through promises goes inside the micro task queue
        2. Mutation Observer (Keeps checking if there is some changes in the DOM)

    "Event loop will take call back functions from callback queue only when all the functions from micro task queue are executed."

    Jusst because event loop gives priority to the micro task queue, and if a micro task creates another task, and that creates another and the chain goes on....... then the task inside the call back queue will never get a chance to execute for a long time, this is  known as starvation of call back queue.
