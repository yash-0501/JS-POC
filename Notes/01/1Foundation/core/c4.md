----------------- Async Await ---------------- 


The async function declaration creates a binding of a new async function to a given name. The await keyword is permitted within the function body, enabling asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style and avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.

function resolveAfter2Seconds() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('resolved');
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function asyncCall() {
  console.log('calling');
  const result = await resolveAfter2Seconds();
  console.log(result);
  // Expected output: "resolved"
}

asyncCall();

An async function declaration creates an AsyncFunction object. Each time when an async function is called, it returns a new Promise which will be resolved with the value returned by the async function, or rejected with an exception uncaught within the async function.

Async functions can contain zero or more await expressions. Await expressions make promise-returning functions behave as though they're synchronous by suspending execution until the returned promise is fulfilled or rejected. The resolved value of the promise is treated as the return value of the await expression. Use of async and await enables the use of ordinary try / catch blocks around asynchronous code.


Note: The await keyword is only valid inside async functions within regular JavaScript code. If you use it outside of an async function's body, you will get a SyntaxError. await can be used on its own with JavaScript modules.

Note: The purpose of async/await is to simplify the syntax necessary to consume promise-based APIs. The behavior of async/await is similar to combining generators and promises.

Async functions always return a promise. If the return value of an async function is not explicitly a promise, it will be implicitly wrapped in a promise.

async function getData(){
    return "JS POC";
}

returns "JS POC" as data in the promise object


The await operator is used to wait for a Promise and get its fulfillment value. It can only be used inside an async function or at the top level of a module.

ASYNC and AWAIT combo is used to handle promises

How did we handle promises before ASYNC AWAIT:

// const p = new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
//     resolve("Promise resolved value");
// });

// function getData(){
//     p.then(res => console.log(res));
// }

// getData();


Handling using async await:

const p = new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
    resolve("Promise resolved value");
});


async function handlePromise(){
    const val = await p;
    console.log(val);
}

handlePromise();

  
Why is Async Await special?

// Normal behaviour without async await:
    // function getData(){
    // JS Engine doesn't wait for the promise to resolve
    //     p.then(res => console.log(res));
    //     console.log("JS POC")
    // }

    // getData();
    // JS POC
    // Promise resolved value


With Async await:

async function handlePromise(){
  // JS Engine waits for the promise to get resolved
    const val = await p;
    console.log("ASYNC AWAIT 1")
    console.log(val);
    
    const val = await p;
    console.log("ASYNC AWAIT 2")
    console.log(val);
    
}
// After 10 seconds both the promises get resolved


handlePromise();
// waits for 10 seconds to get the promise resolved 
// ASYNC AWAIT
// Promise is resolved


async function handlePromise(){
    const val = await p1; // If it's time is lesser, it will be printed first, but second promise isn't printed first
    console.log("ASYNC AWAIT")
    console.log(val);
    
    const val2 = await p2; // Completed in 5 seconds but gets printed after 10 s
    console.log("ASYNC AWAIT 2")
    console.log(val2);
    
}
// After 10 secodnds all the promises gets resolved and all are printed in the order



handlePromise();
// waits for 10 seconds to get the promise resolved 
// ASYNC AWAIT
// Promise is resolved


JS engine appears waits for the promise to be resolved -> how does it work behind the scene


async function handlePromise(){
    const val = await p1; // If it's time is lesser, it will be printed first, but second promise isn't printed first
    console.log("ASYNC AWAIT")
    console.log(val);
    
    const val2 = await p2; // Completed in 5 seconds but gets printed after 10 s
    console.log("ASYNC AWAIT 2")
    console.log(val2);
    
}
// After 10 secodnds all the promises gets resolved and all are printed in the order



handlePromise();
// waits for 10 seconds to get the promise resolved 
// ASYNC AWAIT
// Promise is resolved


// Real world example using fetch

const API_URL = "https://api.github.com/users/yash-051";

async function handlePromise(){
    try{
        const data = await fetch(API_URL);
        const jsonValue = await data.json();
        console.log(jsonValue);
    }catch (err){
        console.log(err);
    }
}

handlePromise();
