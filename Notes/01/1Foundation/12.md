DOM - Document Object Model

The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of a document—such as the HTML representing a web page—in memory. Usually it refers to JavaScript, even though modeling HTML, SVG, or XML documents as objects are not part of the core JavaScript language.

The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree. With them, you can change the document's structure, style, or content.

Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.


All the html code is present in window.document.

Using this document object we can interact with the html using JS

The HTML DOM API is made up of the interfaces that define the functionality of each of the elements in HTML, as well as any supporting types and interfaces they rely upon.

The functional areas included in the HTML DOM API include:

    Access to and control of HTML elements via the DOM.
    Access to and manipulation of form data.
    Interacting with the contents of 2D images and the context of an HTML <canvas>, for example to draw on top of them.
    Management of media connected to the HTML media elements (<audio> and <video>).
    Dragging and dropping of content on webpages.
    Access to the browser navigation history
    Supporting and connective interfaces for other APIs such as Web Components, Web Storage, Web Workers, WebSocket, and Server-sent events.
