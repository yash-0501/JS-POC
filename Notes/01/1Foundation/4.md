-------------- BLOCK SCOPE & SHADOWING -----------------
{}
A block is defined by '{}' (curly braces). It is a perfectly valid JS Code, it does nothing

Block is also known as compund statement

A block is used to combine multiple JS Statements into a group

We group multiple statements in a block when JS Engine expects a single statement

eg: if(true) console.log(true);

Here if we want to run multiple statements, we will have to use a block

if(true){
    let a = true;
    console.log(a);
} 
 These two statements are wrapped together with help of {}
// let a = true;
// console.log(a);
 
 Since if expects a single statement.

 Block Scope - What all vars and functions we declare inside this block

 {
    var a = 10;
    let b = 20;
    const c = 30;
 }

In the above snippet, the variables b and c are hoisted inside the block scope, but a is hoisted inside the global scope/object.

That is why it is said that let and const are block scoped, since we cannot access the let b and const c outside the blocked scope

Whereas we can access the var a, even outside since it is in the global scope.

If we try to access b or c outside the globla scope it will give referenve error b/c is not defined

Once the block is finished executing the block scope, it is gone and the memory is also deleted.


------- SHADOWING IN JS ---------

var a = 100;
{
    var a = 10;
    let b = 20;
    const c = 30;

    console.log(a);
    console.log(b);
    console.log(c);
}

console.log(a);

// 10
// 20
// 30
// 10

If we have a variable with same name outside the block, so the variable inside the block will shadow outside one, here a is in the global scope and both these variables use the same memory location. A is present in the global scope and the block scope as well, but has only one memory location which is in the global scope/execution context.

That is why the value a changes to 10 outside the block


var b = 100;
{
    var a = 10;
    let b = 20;
    const c = 30;

    console.log(a);
    console.log(b);
    console.log(c);
}

console.log(b);

// 10
// 20
// 30
// 100

It prints 100 outside the block, because the let keyword is block scoped. So b inside the block will have a block scope and the global b will be present in the Script space which is the seperate memory for the const/let

Same thing will happen with const as well

Even in the function scope, shadowing works the same way


Illegal Shadowing: 
        // Illegal Shadowing
        let a = 20;
        {
            var a = 20;
        }

        // SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared

        When we try to shadow a let using a var. We can shadow let using a let but not with var

        But shadowing var using a let works fine:
            var a = 10;
            {
                let a = 100;
                console.log(a);
            }

            console.log(a);

            // 100
            // 10

        Why ---> Block scope also follows lexical scope
        For each block there is a scope and the lexical scope chain pattern is followed
