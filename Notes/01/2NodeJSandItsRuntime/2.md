Client  (requests) --> server

request goes into the event queue, then it goes to event loop

Blocking --> sync
Non Blocking --> async

Same as how JS works behind the scenes


What is the Event Loop?
The event loop is what allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations — despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded — by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.



Event Loop Explained
When Node.js starts, it initializes the event loop, processes the provided input script (or drops into the REPL, which is not covered in this document) which may make async API calls, schedule timers, or call process.nextTick(), then begins processing the event loop.

The following diagram shows a simplified overview of the event loop's order of operations.

   ┌───────────────────────────┐
┌─>│           timers          │
│  └─────────────┬─────────────┘
│  ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
│  │     pending callbacks     │
│  └─────────────┬─────────────┘
│  ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
│  │       idle, prepare       │
│  └─────────────┬─────────────┘      ┌───────────────┐
│  ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐      │   incoming:   │
│  │           poll            │<─────┤  connections, │
│  └─────────────┬─────────────┘      │   data, etc.  │
│  ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐      └───────────────┘
│  │           check           │
│  └─────────────┬─────────────┘
│  ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
└──┤      close callbacks      │
   └───────────────────────────┘

Each box will be referred to as a "phase" of the event loop.

Each phase has a FIFO queue of callbacks to execute. While each phase is special in its own way, generally, when the event loop enters a given phase, it will perform any operations specific to that phase, then execute callbacks in that phase's queue until the queue has been exhausted or the maximum number of callbacks has executed. When the queue has been exhausted or the callback limit is reached, the event loop will move to the next phase, and so on.

Since any of these operations may schedule more operations and new events processed in the poll phase are queued by the kernel, poll events can be queued while polling events are being processed. As a result, long running callbacks can allow the poll phase to run much longer than a timer's threshold. See the timers and poll sections for more details.


Phases Overview
timers: this phase executes callbacks scheduled by setTimeout() and setInterval().
pending callbacks: executes I/O callbacks deferred to the next loop iteration.
idle, prepare: only used internally.
poll: retrieve new I/O events; execute I/O related callbacks (almost all with the exception of close callbacks, the ones scheduled by timers, and setImmediate()); node will block here when appropriate.
check: setImmediate() callbacks are invoked here.
close callbacks: some close callbacks, e.g. socket.on('close', ...).
Between each run of the event loop, Node.js checks if it is waiting for any asynchronous I/O or timers and shuts down cleanly if there are not any.

--------------- create a server using node js ----------------




const http = require("http");

const myServer = http.createServer((req,res)=>{
    console.log("new req received");
    res.end("hello!")
});

myServer.listen(8000, ()=>console.log("Server started on port 8000!"));

When we run this on local host, we see that it is logged twice--> the res is logged twice in the console because:
modern web browsers sending a request to the server for the favicon.ico (favicon) automatically when you access a web page. This additional request can cause your server to log the request twice.

// Logging

const http = require("http");
const fs = require("fs");

const myServer = http.createServer((req,res)=>{
    const log = `${Date.now().toLocaleString()}: New Request Received \n`
    fs.appendFile('log.txt', log, (err, data)=>{
        res.end("hello!")
    });
    
});

myServer.listen(8000, ()=>console.log("Server started on port 8000!"));
